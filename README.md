# passwordGenerator

A fun challenge that I think I did pretty well on. There are certainly some inefficient methods I used especially with defining the character arrays I'm sure but it works :)

There's also some nested functions that probably don't need to be nested but I think it's a bit easier to read with them the way they are.

I think I spent a good hour or 2 trying to fix the for loop as it kept looping...and not stopping. I misunderstood how the interation parameter worked so it just kept iterating until my browser closed itself. That was fun.

If I had more time or rather if I was a perfectionist I would change the confirm prompts into just regular prompts. I would have to verify the users input on those but I don't like how the confirm prompt is asking a yes or no question and the options it gives you are "Okay" and "Cancel" which are not very intuitive.

# How to use

Whenever you want a password, simply click the "Generate Password" button, follow the prompts and decide how many and what kind of characters you want to have in the password, and boom the password will generate into the box.
